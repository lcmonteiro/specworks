# Spec Delta: project

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-PROJ-025 Setting a command or the context

The system SHALL set `commands.<key>` (a key of `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`,
`build`, `format`) or `context` in a project's config, editing it as text:
the user's comments and the other entries SHALL be kept. A command SHALL be
one line under `commands:`, replacing that key's line when there is one; the
context SHALL be a block replacing the `context:` entry there. An empty value
SHALL clear the key. Any other key SHALL be refused before writing, naming the
keys it accepts. When the edit would not load with the new value and every
other entry unchanged, the file SHALL be left unchanged and the error SHALL
say to set the key by hand.

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.1 A command set with the comments kept

- **GIVEN** the default config written by `init`
- **WHEN** `commands.test` is set to `uv run pytest`
- **THEN** the config loads with that test command, its comments are still there, and it has one `test:` line

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.2 A command replaced

- **GIVEN** a config whose `commands.lint` is `ruff check .`
- **WHEN** `commands.lint` is set to `uv run ruff check src`
- **THEN** the config loads with the new lint command, has one `lint:` line, and its other commands are unchanged

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.3 A command added to a config without commands

- **GIVEN** a config with no `commands:` entry
- **WHEN** `commands.build` is set to `make`
- **THEN** the config loads with that build command

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.4 A command with YAML characters

- **WHEN** `commands.test` is set to `pytest -k "a or b" # all: yes`
- **THEN** the config loads with exactly that test command

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.5 A command cleared

- **GIVEN** a config whose `commands.lint` is `ruff check .`
- **WHEN** `commands.lint` is set to an empty value
- **THEN** the config loads with no lint command and its other commands unchanged

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.6 The context set

- **GIVEN** the default config written by `init`
- **WHEN** `context` is set to a text of three lines
- **THEN** the config loads with exactly that text as its context, and the entries after `context:` are unchanged

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.7 The context replaced

- **GIVEN** a config whose context is a block of two lines
- **WHEN** `context` is set to another text
- **THEN** the config loads with the new text only and has one `context:` entry

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.8 An unknown key

- **WHEN** `commands.unit` or `docs_dir` is set
- **THEN** it is refused naming the keys it accepts, and the config file is unchanged

#### Scenario: AC-PROJ-025.9 An entry the text edit cannot change

- **GIVEN** a config with `commands: {test: pytest}`
- **WHEN** `commands.lint` is set to `ruff check .`
- **THEN** the config file is unchanged and the error says to set `commands.lint` by hand
