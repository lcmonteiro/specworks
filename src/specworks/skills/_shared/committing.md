**Committing**: once this phase's gate has passed (a phase with no gate: once its
artifact is written), and before the closing question, commit with specworks commit --change "<ref>":
- it stages the change folder and every file that changed since the phase
  started, and nothing else (never `git add -A`); do not stage or commit by
  hand;
- the subject is `<ref>: <phase>`; when the project has a commit convention (a
  commit skill, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, the project
  `context`), follow it with `--message "<subject>"` and add its trailers with
  `--trailer "Key: value"` (repeat it, in order);
- name in the report the files it lists as left out (dirty before the phase
  started, not committed) and as already dirty when the phase started
  (committed whole);
- `nothing to commit` is not an error: go on;
- never push: only `/specworks-close` and `/specworks-done` offer that.
